# advanced-calculator
A freely typed calculator with advanced functions:

Current features:
1) Works with Integers, decimals, scientific constants and variables (unstable with variables as of now)
2) Both degrees and radians supported: the commands to change mode are "$ degree mode" and "$ radian mode"
3) Unary functions: factorial, reciprocal, sqrt, cbrt, log (base 10), ln (base e), trig, inverse trig
4) Binary functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, power, permutation, combination, log_(base) (number)
5) Mutiple argument functions: Mean and standard deviation
6) Constants:

  a) Mathematical constants: pi, Euler's number, golden ratio 
  
  b) Universal constants: speed of light, Planck's constant, reduced Planck constant
  
  c) Atomic and nuclear constants: masses of proton, neutron and electron, Bohr radius, fine structure constant, Hartree energy, Rydberg's constant, 1st and 2nd radiation constant
  
  d) Physio-chemical constants: atomic mass unit, Avogadro number, Boltzmann constant, Faraday constant, universal gas constant, Stefan - Boltzmann constant, Wien's constant
  
  e) Electromagnetic constants: vacuum permittivity, vacuum permeability, vacuum impedance, Coulomb's constant, elementary charge, Bohr magneton, nuclear magneton, Von Klitzing constant
